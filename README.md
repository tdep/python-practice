# python-practice

Within this repository are (or will be) oodles of simple little programs written in python. They will range in size and complexity as I get more comfortable, but overall is just a way for me to practice syntax and concepts without worrying about frameworks and larger-scale problems. 

To run:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to the main directory.
3. Choose one of the programs (listed by the name of the file they're in).
4. Run from the terminal using `python -i [filename.py]`.
